Changelog
------------

### 1.2.1
* 🎉 Improved Flow types to include optional `itemData` parameter. ([TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) - [#66](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/66))
* 🐛 `VariableSizeList` and `VariableSizeGrid` no longer call size getter functions with invalid index when item count is zero.

### 1.2.0
* 🎉 Flow types added to NPM package. ([TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) - [#40](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/40))
* 🎉 Relaxed grid `scrollTo` method to make `scrollLeft` and `scrollTop` params _optional_ (so you can only update one axis if desired). - [#63](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/63))
* 🐛 Fixed invalid `this` pointer in `VariableSizeGrid` that broke the `resetAfter*` methods - [#58](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/58))
* Upgraded to babel 7 and used shared runtime helpers to reduce package size slightly. ([TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) - [#48](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/48))
* Remove `overflow:hidden` from inner container ([souporserious](https://github.com/souporserious) - [#56](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/56))

### 1.1.2
* 🐛 Fixed edge case `scrollToItem` bug that caused lists/grids with very few items to have negative scroll offsets.

### 1.1.1
* 🐛 `FixedSizeGrid` and `FixedSizeList` automatically clear style cache when item size props change.

### 1.1.0
* 🎉 Use explicit `constructor` and `super` to generate cleaner component code. ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#26](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/26))
* 🎉 Add optional `shouldForceUpdate` param reset-index methods to specify `forceUpdate` behavior. ([nihgwu](https://github.com/nihgwu) - [#32](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/32))

### 1.0.3
* 🐛 Avoid unnecessary scrollbars for lists (e.g. no horizontal scrollbar for a vertical list) unless content requires them.

### 1.0.2

* 🎉 Enable Babel `annotate-pure-calls` option so that classes compiled by "transform-es2015-classes" are annotated with `#__PURE__`. This enables [UglifyJS to remove them if they are not referenced](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/pull/1448), improving dead code elimination in application code. ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#20](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/20))
* 🎉 Update "rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external" and use new `includeDependencies` flag so that the "memoize-one" dependency does not get inlined into the Rollup bundle. ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#19](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/19))
* 🎉 Enable [Babel "loose" mode](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#loose) to reduce package size (-8%). ([Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) - [#18](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/pull/18))
